The Kubernetes Control Plane is an important component to back up and protect against failure. There are certain best practices you can take to ensure you donâ€™t have a single point of failure. If your Control Plane components are not effectively communicating, there are a few things you can check to ensure your cluster is operating efficiently.

Check the events in the kube-system namespace for errors:
kubectl get events -n kube-system

Get the logs from the individual pods in your kube-system namespace and check for errors:
kubectl logs [kube_scheduler_pod_name] -n kube-system

Check the status of the Docker service:
sudo systemctl status docker

Start up and enable the Docker service, so it starts upon bootup:
sudo systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker

Check the status of the kubelet service:
sudo systemctl status kubelet

Start up and enable the kubelet service, so it starts up when the machine is rebooted:
sudo systemctl enable kubelet && systemctl start kubelet

Turn off swap on your machine:
sudo su -
swapoff -a && sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab

Check if you have a firewall running:
sudo systemctl status firewalld

Disable the firewall and stop the firewalld service:
sudo systemctl disable firewalld && systemctl stop firewalld
