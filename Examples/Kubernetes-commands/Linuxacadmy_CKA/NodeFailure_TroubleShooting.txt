Troubleshooting worker node failure is a lot like troubleshooting a non-responsive server, in addition to the kubectl tools we have at our disposal. In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn how to recover a node and add it back to the cluster and find out how to identify when the kublet service is down. 

Listing the status of the nodes should be the first step:

kubectl get nodes

Find out more information about the nodes with kubectl describe:

kubectl describe nodes chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com

You can try to log in to your server via SSH:

ssh chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com

Get the IP address of your nodes:

kubectl get nodes -o wide

Use the IP address to further probe the server:

ssh cloud_user@172.31.29.182

Generate a new token after spinning up a new server:

sudo kubeadm token generate

Create the kubeadm join command for your new worker node:

sudo kubeadm token create [token_name] --ttl 2h --print-join-command
View the journalctl logs:

sudo journalctl -u kubelet

View the syslogs:

sudo more syslog | tail -120 | grep kubelet
