#For our Ingress Controller, we're going to go with nginx, widely available and easy to use. 
#Follow this link here to find a manifest for nginx Ingress Controller for various infrastructures, Cloud, Bare Metal, EKS and more.
#We have to choose a platform to deploy in...we can choose Cloud, Bare-metal (which we can use in our local cluster) and more.
https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/


#Cloud: Azure (Same for GCE-GKE) This Ingress Controller will be exposed as a LoadBalancer service on a real public IP.
#Let's make sure we're in the right context and deploy the manifest for the Ingress Controller found in the link just above (around line 9).
kubectl config use-context 'CSCluster'
kubectl apply -f ./cloud/deploy.yaml

#Check out 1-ingress-nodeport.sh for the on-prem demos

#Using this manifest, the Ingress Controller is in the ingress-nginx namespace but 
#It will monitor for Ingresses in all namespaces by default. If can be scoped to monitor a specific namespace if needed.


#Check the status of the pods to see if the ingress controller is online.
kubectl get pods --namespace ingress-nginx


#Now let's check to see if the service is online. This of type LoadBalancer, so do you have an EXTERNAL-IP?
kubectl get services --namespace ingress-nginx


#Create a deployment, scale it to 2 replicas and expose it as a serivce. 
#This service will be ClusterIP and we'll expose this service via the Ingress.
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-single --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
kubectl scale deployment hello-world-service-single --replicas=2
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-single --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP


#Create a single Ingress routing to the one backend service on the service port 80 listening on all hostnames
kubectl apply -f ingress-single.yaml


#Get the status of the ingress. It's routing for all host names on that public IP on port 80
#This IP will be the same as the EXTERNAL-IP of the ingress controller...will take a second to update
kubectl get ingress --watch
kubectl get services --namespace ingress-nginx


#Notice the backends are the Service's Endpoints...so the traffic is going straight from the Ingress Controller to the Pod cutting out the kube-proxy hop.
#Also notice, the default backend is the same service, that's because we didn't define any rules and
#we just populated ingress.spec.backend. We're going to look at rules next...
kubectl describe ingress ingress-single


#Access the application via the exposed ingress on the public IP
INGRESSIP=$(kubectl get ingress -o jsonpath='{ .items[].status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip }')
curl http://$INGRESSIP





#Let's create two additional services
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-blue --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-red  --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0

kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-blue --port=4343 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-red  --port=4242 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP


#Let's create an ingress with paths each routing to different backend services.
kubectl apply -f ingress-path.yaml


#We now have two, one for all hosts and the other for our defined host with two paths
#The Ingress controller is implementing these ingresses and we're sharing the one public IP, don't proceed until you see 
#the address populated for your ingress
kubectl get ingress --watch


#We can see the host, the path, and the backends.
kubectl describe ingress ingress-path


#Our ingress on all hosts is still routing to service single, since we're accessing the URL with an IP and not a domain name or host header.
curl http://$INGRESSIP/


#Our paths are routing to their correct services, if we specify a host header or use a DNS name to access the ingress. That's how the rule will route the request.
curl http://$INGRESSIP/red  --header 'Host: path.example.com'
curl http://$INGRESSIP/blue --header 'Host: path.example.com'


#If we don't specify a path we'll get a 404 while specifying a host header. 
#We'll need to configure a path and backend for / or define a default backend for the service
curl http://$INGRESSIP/     --header 'Host: path.example.com'


#Let's add a backend to the ingress listenting on path.example.com pointing to the single service
kubectl apply -f ingress-path-backend.yaml


#We can see the default backend, and in the Rules, the host, the path, and the backends.
kubectl describe ingress ingress-path


#Now we'll hit the default backend service, single
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: path.example.com'


#Now, let's route traffic to the services using named based virtual hosts rather than paths, wait for ADDRESS to be populated
kubectl apply -f ingress-namebased.yaml
kubectl get ingress --watch

curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: red.example.com'
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: blue.example.com'


#What about a name based virtual host that doesn't exist?
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: what.example.com'


#Why did it go to single? Remember our first ingress? It's listening on all hosts, so unspecified names will match there.
kubectl delete ingress ingress-single


#This time we'll get a 404 because there's no ingress at this undefined host header and there's no default backend.
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: what.example.com'




#TLS Example
#1 - Generate a certificate
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=ILLINOIS/L=CHICAGO/O=IT/OU=IT/CN=tls.example.com"


#2 - Create a secret with the key and the certificate
kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key tls.key --cert tls.crt


#3 - Create an ingress using the certificate and key. This uses HTTPS for both / and /red 
kubectl apply -f ingress-tls.yaml


#Check the status...do we have an IP?
kubectl get ingress --watch


#Test access to the hostname...we need --resolve because we haven't registered the DNS name
#TLS is a layer lower than host headers, so we have to specify the correct DNS name. 
curl https://tls.example.com:443 --resolve tls.example.com:443:$INGRESSIP --insecure --verbose
