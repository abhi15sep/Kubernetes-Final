*** In kubernetes v1.19 Ingress went GA under the API group networking.k8s.io/v1 ****

Detail here:
    https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/09/kubernetes-ingress-goes-ga.html

The syntax of the examples has changes, but logically they are the same. I will be updating the video course soon.
I have provideded updated examples for networking.k8s.io/v1 in the root folder of this modules demos.

 - If you cluster is v1.19+ then use the examples in the root of this folder.
 - If you cluster is any version before v1.19 use the examples in the folder demos_prior_to_1.19.


If you need help, shoot me an email or hit me up on the course discussion page

Thanks,
    Anthony
