# Contributing Guide

1. The folder structure for all topics and associated practice tests are created already. Use the same pattern to create one if it doesn't exist.
2. Create a file with your answers. If you have a different answer than the one that is already there, create a new answer file with your name in it.
4. Do not post the entire question. Only post the question number.
3. Send in a pull request
