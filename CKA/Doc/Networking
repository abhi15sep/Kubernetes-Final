Kubernetes DNS-Based Service Discovery:

NOTES:
1. While testing the Network Namespaces, if you come across issues where you can't ping one namespace from the other, make sure you set the NETMASK while setting IP Address. ie: 192.168.1.10/24
ip -n red addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev veth-red
Another thing to check is FirewallD/IP Table rules. Either add rules to IP Tables to allow traffic from one namespace to another. Or disable IP Tables all together (Only in a learning environment).

2. Network Addons: This includes installing a network plugin in the cluster. While we have used weave-net as an example, please bear in mind that you can use any of the plugins which are described here:
